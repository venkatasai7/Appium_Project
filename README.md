# 📱 Appium Automation Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases my hands-on experience with **mobile automation testing** using **Appium and Python**.  
The project focuses on automating real iOS simulator interactions to validate both **native app workflows** and **mobile web workflows**.

Two mini automation projects are implemented to demonstrate practical Appium skills.
